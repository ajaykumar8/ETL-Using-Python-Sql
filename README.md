# **End-to-End ETL Pipeline Project**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline where I extract raw data from Kaggle, clean and transform it using Python, load it into a SQL Server database, and perform data analysis using SQL.

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Extract**: 
   - Extracted data from the Kaggle API using Python.
   
2. **Transform**: 
   - Cleaned and transformed the raw data using Python libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`. 
   - Applied necessary transformations such as handling missing values, normalizing data, and preparing it for database loading.

3. **Load**: 
   - Loaded the cleaned data into a SQL Server database using `SQLAlchemy`.
   
4. **Data Analysis**: 
   - Conducted in-depth data analysis in SQL Server to uncover trends and insights.
   - Used SQL queries to generate reports and derive actionable insights from the data.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: For data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `SQLAlchemy`, `pyodbc`
  
- **Kaggle API**: To extract data from Kaggle datasets.

- **SQL Server**: As the database for storing and querying data.

- **SQL**: For performing data analysis and generating insights.

## **Installation and Setup**

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **SQL Server**
- **Kaggle API Key**: Set up the [Kaggle API](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api) for downloading datasets.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ETL-Pipeline-Project.git
cd ETL-Pipeline-Project
```

### Install Required Python Libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Kaggle API Setup
1. Install the Kaggle CLI by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install kaggle
   ```
2. Place your Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`) in the appropriate directory:
   - For Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\.kaggle\kaggle.json`
   - For Mac/Linux: `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`

### Running the Project
1. **Extract the data**:
   - Run the extraction script to download the dataset from Kaggle:
     ```bash
     python extract_data.py
     ```

2. **Transform and Load the data**:
   - Run the transformation and loading script to clean the data and load it into SQL Server:
     ```bash
     python transform_load.py
     ```

3. **Perform Data Analysis**:
   - SQL queries for data analysis can be found in the `data_analysis.sql` file. You can execute them in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

## **Key Learnings**
- Integrated data extraction from external APIs (Kaggle) into an ETL pipeline.
- Applied data cleaning and transformation techniques using Python.
- Gained experience loading data into SQL Server using SQLAlchemy and `pyodbc`.
- Conducted efficient data analysis in SQL to uncover meaningful insights.

## **Next Steps**
- Visualize the data using Power BI or Tableau to create insightful dashboards.
- Extend the analysis by integrating more datasets from Kaggle.
